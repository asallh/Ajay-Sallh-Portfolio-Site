# Hi! 
Welcome to my portfolio. Let me cut to the chase...
- 2021 Ba Law and Society @Ucalgary ü¶ñ
- Did parkour (ask me to do a backflip)
- current CS student @Ucalgary
- Currently interning at Strathcona Resources as a Data Dev
- Previous inter at Cenouvs Energy in Infra and Cloud   

I love tech talk and love building. I annoy too many people with my obsession of Docker, coding, and other random mini projects. 

This is going to be my blog where I will essentially be writing out adventures and previous archives that I have in my journals. 

Anyone who ever you are, feel free to reach out!
